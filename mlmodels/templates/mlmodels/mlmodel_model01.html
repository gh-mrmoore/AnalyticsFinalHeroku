    <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Ask:</h3>
    <p>Does the victim's age, gender, relationship to the person that 
        recruited them and citizenship predict the type of exploitation?</p>
    <p>Polaris-reported human trafficking appears to fall in to one of five major 
        types of exploitation: sexual, forced labor, forced marriage, slavery and other/multiple exploits.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Data ETL</h3>
    <p>Categorical data was converted to numerical data using multiple loops and <code>.replace</code> cells within a Jupyter Notebook.
        This transformation was necessary to meet the requirements of our machine learning model. Null values were dropped as we could 
        not presume to know things like country of origin or reasonably infer things like gender based on the information available.</p>
    <h3>Model Choice</h3>
    <p>Initial modeling attempts were made using both deep learning neural networks as well as unsupervised learning models to predict a 
        categorical outcome. When those efforts resulted in less than desirable predictive models, consultations with our instructor led 
        to the creation of a supervised, multi-class logistic regression model.
    </p>
    <h4>Model Performance</h4>
    <p>In predicting the type of exploitation, our chosen model performed well. Using SciKit-Learn, an accuracy score of .969 was calculated. Further 
        examination using <code>classification_report</code> yielded the following:
