    <h2>Communication Protocols</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Needs</h3>
    <p>As each team member will contribute to different parts of the project over time, 
        communication throughout each segmenet of the project is essential. Communication 
        will be maintained regularly meetings will be planned according to team members' 
        schedules.</p>

    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>We plan to use a combination of Jupyter Notebooks, Python, plotly, MapBox, d3 and 
        likely other libraries to, hopefully, host our project on Heroku.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
    <p>Best case scenario will be an interactive use of our models. We also plan to have interactive 
        heat maps on various statistics and charts. Deployment particulars may affect this goal. 
        A rough mock-up of our site is below:

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Efficient collaboration between teammates can either make or break a project. Communication, 
        as part of collaboration is essential for success. Regular updates to stakeholders can help 
        to remove blockages from a given workflow and can allow parallel development of different 
        aspects of a given project without one necessarily waiting on another.</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <h4>GitHub Projects</h4>
    <p>A basic Kanban project has been created in the Project GitHub repository. This will enable 
        team members to track progress as items are completed.</p>

    <h4>Slack</h4>
    <p>Using Slack to message other team members and share resources will be essential. Sharing 
        links and possibly files via Slack should improve the quality of work.</p> 

    <h4>Zoom</h4>
    <p>Regular Zoom meetings (both during and outside of regular class time) will be held to 
        accomplish the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brainstorm</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot</li>
        <li>Plan for next steps</li>
        <li>Debate and determine best models and/or datasets and/or technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Canvas</h4>
    <p>As provided by the class instructor and teaching assistants, a calendar and other resources 
        are available in Canvas. Meetings will be posted on the calendar and other resources 
        (Collaborations, Files, Discussions, etc) shall be utilized when or if appropriate.</p>

    <h3>Cadence</h3>
    <p>The group shall meet at least twice weekly (Monday and Wednesday during regularly scheduled 
        class time) and as often as possible or necessary outside of the regular, twice-weekly, meetings.</p>
